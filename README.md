 <h4> Inspiration for the project </h4>
 <p> The inspiration of Technoply is the Coin Gecko API and Apple Stocks IOS stock application services that fetch and display real-time analytics with visual graphs representing the data which is easy to understand for users to access and use. Alongside my passion for Computer Science, I spend a lot of my spare time learning about finance: reading books, keeping up to date with the stock market and watching content creators who focus on finance content. I decided it was a good idea to take on an ambitious personal project to plan, design and develop a website focused on finance with an emphasis on digital currency and crypto. During development, I didn't have any experience building a website using frameworks and the project was built in Vanilla JavaScript to test my abilities while learning JavaScript through the first half of 2024.  </p>
